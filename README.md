# IceandFire

## The project

This was a simple school project, which uses the https://anapioficeandfire.com/ API for Ice and Fire fantasy world, which allows us to access informations about books, the houses and the characters.

The task was to make a simple UWP app following the MVVM pattern. In this app we can walk through the fantasy world's houses and characters.

## Used tecnhologies

For the MVVM pattern i used Prism MVVM because of the Autowire possibility and simple usage.
For the API calls i have a static service class that have different methods for the different Model types.
